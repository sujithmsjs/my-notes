### 1. What is React?

React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly for creating interactive and dynamic web applications. 

React is a front-end and open-source JavaScript library which is useful in developing user interfaces specifically for applications with a single page. It is helpful in building complex and reusable user interface(UI) components of mobile and web applications as it follows the component-based approach.

### 2. What are the advantages of using React?


Key features and concepts of React include:

- Component-Based Architecture
- Reusable components
- Virtual DOM
- Unidirectional Data Flow
- Gentle learning curve
- JSX
- Hooks
- Community Echosystem
- Server-Side Rendering

Component-Based Architecture: React encourages developers to break down the user interface into reusable, self-contained components. Each component represents a specific part of the UI and can have its own state, logic, and rendering. This approach promotes code modularity and reusability.

Virtual DOM (Document Object Model): React introduces the concept of a virtual DOM, which is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the actual DOM in a web page. When changes are made to the UI, React updates the virtual DOM first and then efficiently determines the difference between the virtual DOM and the actual DOM (reconciliation), updating only the parts of the page that have changed. This approach enhances performance and minimizes direct manipulation of the real DOM.

Unidirectional Data Flow: React follows a unidirectional data flow, meaning that data flows in one direction through a hierarchy of components. Changes to data originate from a single source of truth (usually at the top-level component) and propagate down through child components. This predictable data flow simplifies data management and debugging.

JSX (JavaScript XML): React uses JSX, a syntax extension for JavaScript, to define the structure of the user interface. JSX allows developers to write HTML-like code directly within their JavaScript files, making the code more readable and expressive. JSX is transpiled into standard JavaScript by tools like Babel before execution in the browser.

Hooks: React introduced hooks in React 16.8, which allow functional components to manage state and side effects. Hooks, such as useState and useEffect, eliminate the need for class-based components and provide a more flexible and predictable way to work with component state and lifecycle events.

Component Lifecycle: While class components have a lifecycle with methods like componentDidMount, functional components can emulate similar behavior using hooks like useEffect.

Community and Ecosystem: React has a vibrant community and a vast ecosystem of libraries, tools, and extensions, both officially maintained by Facebook and developed by the community. This rich ecosystem allows developers to extend React's functionality and integrate it with various technologies.

Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG): React can be used for server-side rendering and static site generation, improving SEO and initial page load times. Libraries like Next.js and Gatsby provide solutions for implementing SSR and SSG with React.

### 4. What is useState() in React?

The useState() is a built-in React Hook that allows you for having state variables in functional components. It should be used when the DOM has something that is dynamically manipulating/controlling.

### 5. What are keys in React?

Importance of keys -

- Keys help react identify which elements were added, changed or removed.
- Keys should be given to array elements for providing a unique identity for each element.
- Without keys, React does not understand the order or uniqueness of each element.
- With keys, React has an idea of which particular element was deleted, edited, and added.
- Keys are generally used for displaying a list of data coming from an API.


In React, keys are a crucial concept when rendering lists of elements, such as arrays of components or DOM elements.
They serve as a hint to React about the identity and state of elements within a list. The importance of keys in React lies in several key aspects:

- Efficient Updates and Reconciliation
- Stable Identity
- Optimizing Animations and Transitions
- State Preservation
- Avoiding Duplicate Key Warnings
- Enhancing Predictability and Debugging

Efficient Updates and Reconciliation:
Keys help React identify which items have changed, been added, or been removed within a list when the component re-renders. This enables React to perform updates efficiently without re-rendering the entire list. Instead, React can selectively update only the elements that have changed or need to be updated.

Stable Identity:
Keys provide a stable identity for elements within a list. Without keys, React relies on the order of elements to determine their identity. If the order of elements changes, React might mistakenly think that elements have been added or removed, resulting in unintended behavior.

Optimizing Animations and Transitions:
When animating or transitioning elements in a list, having stable keys is essential. It ensures that React can smoothly animate elements from their previous position to their new position, providing a better user experience.

State Preservation:
React maintains the state of components, and keys help React associate the old component state with the corresponding element in the new list. This ensures that component state is preserved correctly, even if the order of elements changes.

Avoiding Duplicate Key Warnings:
Specifying unique keys for elements within a list helps developers avoid warnings and errors in the console. React will warn you if it detects elements with duplicate keys, prompting you to address the issue.

Enhancing Predictability and Debugging:
Using keys makes your code more predictable and easier to debug. When you specify keys, you have explicit control over the identity of elements in your list, reducing unexpected behavior and making it easier to trace issues.

### 6. What is JSX?

- JavaScript XML
- HTML inside JS
- Syntactic sugar


JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It allows us to write HTML inside JavaScript and place them in the DOM without using functions like appendChild( ) or createElement( ).

As stated in the official docs of React, JSX provides syntactic sugar for React.createElement( ) function.

### 8. What is the virtual DOM? How does react use the virtual DOM to render the UI?

- Virtual representation of the real DOM.
- Lightweight
- In memory representation
- Reconciliation

The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept used by React to improve the performance and efficiency of updating the user interface (UI) in web applications. It's a lightweight, in-memory representation of the actual DOM (Document Object Model) in a web page. React uses the virtual DOM to efficiently manage updates and minimize direct manipulation of the real DOM, resulting in faster rendering and improved user experience.

Here's how React uses the virtual DOM to render the UI:

1. **Initial Render:**
   When a React component is initially rendered or when its state changes, it generates a virtual DOM tree that represents the desired UI structure. This virtual DOM tree is a JavaScript object that mirrors the structure of the actual DOM but contains no real browser-specific information.

2. **Reconciliation:**
   After generating the virtual DOM, React performs a process called "reconciliation." It compares the newly generated virtual DOM tree with the previous one (from the previous render). React's reconciliation algorithm identifies the differences (diffing) between the two virtual DOM trees.

3. **Minimal Updates:**
   By identifying the differences, React determines the minimal set of changes required to update the actual DOM to match the desired UI structure. This is a key optimization because manipulating the real DOM can be slow and costly in terms of performance.

4. **Updating the Real DOM:**
   React then updates the real DOM efficiently by making only the necessary changes. It avoids re-rendering the entire UI and, instead, selectively applies changes to the DOM elements that have been modified or added. Elements that haven't changed are left untouched.

5. **Event Handling and User Interaction:**
   When users interact with the UI, events such as clicks or input changes trigger changes in the component's state or props. When these events occur, React follows the same process: it generates a new virtual DOM, reconciles it with the previous one, and updates the real DOM accordingly.

6. **Batching Updates:**
   React often batches multiple updates together to optimize performance. Instead of updating the real DOM immediately after every state change, React may wait until it's more efficient to make a batch update. This batching reduces unnecessary DOM manipulation.

The key advantage of using the virtual DOM is that it abstracts away the complexities of direct DOM manipulation and provides a more efficient way to update the UI. By minimizing the number of changes to the real DOM and optimizing the update process, React ensures that web applications remain responsive and performant even as they become more complex.

In summary, React's virtual DOM is a virtual representation of the actual DOM, allowing React to efficiently compute and apply updates to the UI, resulting in improved performance and a smoother user experience. This abstraction of the DOM manipulation process is one of the reasons React has become a popular choice for building web applications.

### 9. What are the differences between controlled and uncontrolled components?


Controlled Components:

- State Management:
	In controlled components, the component's state is used to control the value of form elements (e.g., input fields, checkboxes, radio buttons).

- Single Source of Truth:
	The component's state serves as the single source of truth for the value of the form element. Any changes to the input value are reflected in the component's state, and vice versa.

- Event Handlers:
	Controlled components rely on event handlers (e.g., onChange for input elements) to update the state when the user interacts with the form element.

Advantages:
	Full control over the form element's behavior and value.
	Enables validation and conditional rendering based on the form state.
	Makes it easier to test and predict the behavior of the form.

- Stateful
- Single Source of truth
- Event Handling
- In a controlled component, the value of the input element is controlled by React. We store the state of the input element inside the code, and by using event-based callbacks, any changes made to the input element will be reflected in the code as well.
When a user enters data inside the input element of a controlled component, onChange function gets triggered and inside the code, we check whether the value entered is valid or invalid. If the value is valid, we change the state and re-render the input element with the new value.


Uncontrolled Components:

- Stateless:
	In uncontrolled components, the component's state does not control the form element's value. Instead, the form element maintains its own internal state.

- No Single Source of Truth:
	There is no single source of truth for the form element's value; it's maintained by the DOM itself.

- Ref-Based Access:
	Uncontrolled components often use React refs (ref) to access and manipulate the form element directly in the DOM.

- Advantages:
	Simplicity and reduced boilerplate for simple forms.
	Integration with non-React code or libraries that rely on traditional DOM event handling.
-	In an uncontrolled component, the value of the input element is handled by the DOM itself. Input elements inside uncontrolled components work just like normal HTML input form elements. The state of the input element is handled by the DOM. Whenever the value of the input element is changed, event-based callbacks are not called.Basically, react does not perform any action when there are changes made to the input element.

### 10. What are props in React?

- Data Transfer
- Read only
- Customization
- Dynamic Rendering

In React, "props" (short for "properties") are a mechanism for passing data from a parent component to a child component. They allow you to transmit values, objects, or functions from one component to another, facilitating the flow of data and behavior in a React application. Props are read-only and cannot be modified by the child component that receives them.

Key points about props in React:

1. **Data Transfer:** Props are used to pass data or configuration from a parent component to a child component. This enables you to create reusable and configurable components.

2. **Read-Only:** Props are read-only, meaning that the child component cannot modify the props it receives from the parent. Props are considered immutable within the component that receives them.

3. **Functional Components:** In functional components, props are received as a single argument, typically named `props`, which is an object containing all the properties passed from the parent.

4. **Class Components:** In class-based components, props are accessed using `this.props`.

5. **Customizable Behavior:** Props allow you to customize the behavior or appearance of a component based on the data provided by the parent component. For example, you can pass different text or styling information to a button component using props.

6. **Dynamic Rendering:** Props make it possible to dynamically render child components with different data based on the context or user interactions.



### 11. Explain React state and props.


In React, both state and props are used to manage and pass data within components, but they serve slightly different purposes and have distinct characteristics. Here are the key differences between state and props in React:


State: Every component in react has a built-in state object, which contains all the property values that belong to that component.
Props: Every React component accepts a single object argument called props (which stands for “properties”).  These props can be passed to a component using HTML attributes and the component accepts these props as an argument.


**State:**

1. **Ownership:** State is owned and managed by the component itself. It is an internal data store for a component, and only the component that owns the state can modify it.

2. **Mutability:** State is mutable, meaning that it can be changed over time. You typically use the `this.setState()` method to update the state in class components and the `useState` hook in functional components.

3. **Initialization:** State is typically initialized in the constructor of class components or using the `useState` hook in functional components.

4. **Local Scope:** State is scoped to the component where it is defined. It's not accessible or modifiable by other components.

5. **Reactivity:** Changes to state trigger component re-renders, which means that updating state causes the component to re-render with the updated data.

6. **Examples:** State is used for managing dynamic data within a component, such as form inputs, user interactions, or component-specific data.

**Props:**

1. **Ownership:** Props are passed from a parent component to a child component. They allow data to flow from parent to child components, enabling parent components to configure and customize their child components.

2. **Immutability:** Props are read-only and cannot be modified by the child component that receives them. They are intended to be a one-way communication mechanism.

3. **Initialization:** Props are passed from a parent component to a child component when the child component is rendered. The parent component is responsible for initializing and updating the props.

4. **Scope:** Props are scoped to the component hierarchy. A child component can access and use the props passed to it by its parent component.

5. **Reactivity:** Changes to props do not trigger re-renders of the child component that receives them. If the parent component updates the props, the child component will re-render with the new props data.

6. **Examples:** Props are used for passing data and configuration from parent components to child components, such as passing data for rendering, passing callback functions, or configuring the behavior of child components.

In summary, state is used for managing internal, component-specific data that can change over time, while props are used for passing data and configuring child components. Understanding the distinction between state and props is essential for effective component design and communication within a React application.

### 12. Explain about types of side effects in React component.


In React, "side effects" refer to any operations or interactions that occur within a component that are not related to the component's rendering but may have an impact on the component's behavior, the application's state, or the external environment. Side effects can include actions like data fetching, state updates, DOM manipulation, and subscriptions to external data sources. React provides several mechanisms for handling different types of side effects in components:

1. **Data Fetching:**

   - **`componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate` (Class Components):** In class components, you can perform data fetching and other side effects in the `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate` lifecycle methods. These methods are invoked after the component is mounted or updated.

   - **`useEffect` (Functional Components):** In functional components, the `useEffect` hook is used for data fetching and managing other side effects. It allows you to perform operations when the component mounts, updates, or when certain dependencies change.

2. **State Updates:**

   - **`setState` (Class Components):** Updating component state can be considered a side effect, especially when it triggers re-renders. You should use the `setState` method to safely update state in class components.

   - **`useState` (Functional Components):** In functional components, the `useState` hook is used to manage component state updates. It is a function that returns the current state and a function to update it safely.

3. **DOM Manipulation:**

   - **`ref` (Both Class and Functional Components):** React provides the `ref` attribute to access and manipulate DOM elements directly. While direct DOM manipulation should be avoided in most cases, refs can be used when necessary, such as working with third-party libraries or integrating React with non-React code.

4. **Subscriptions and Event Listeners:**

   - **`componentWillUnmount` (Class Components):** In class components, you can remove subscriptions or event listeners in the `componentWillUnmount` lifecycle method to avoid memory leaks when the component is unmounted.

   - **`useEffect` Cleanup Function (Functional Components):** In functional components, you can return a cleanup function from the `useEffect` hook to handle subscription teardown and cleanup when the component unmounts.

5. **Context and Context Providers:**

   - **Context API:** React's Context API allows you to manage shared state and data across components. It can be used to encapsulate side-effect-related state and provide it to components that need it.

6. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG):**

   - **`getInitialProps` (Next.js):** In Next.js applications, you can use the `getInitialProps` function to fetch data and perform side effects during server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG).

7. **Custom Hooks:**

   - **Custom Hooks:** You can create custom hooks to encapsulate and reuse side-effect-related logic across different components. Custom hooks can abstract away complex side effects and make them more reusable and testable.

8. **Error Handling:**

   - **Error Boundaries:** React provides error boundaries to capture and handle errors that occur during rendering or side effects in a component tree. Error boundaries help prevent errors from crashing the entire application.

Handling side effects correctly is essential for building robust and maintainable React applications. React's lifecycle methods, hooks, and other patterns provide structured ways to manage different types of side effects and ensure that components behave predictably and efficiently.


### 13. What is prop drilling in React?


"Prop drilling" in React refers to the process of passing props (properties) down the component hierarchy, from a higher-level or parent component to one or more lower-level or nested child components. This can occur when data or functions need to be shared with components that are several levels deep in the component tree. Prop drilling is sometimes also referred to as "prop passing" or "prop threading."

The term "drilling" is used to convey the idea that props are being passed down through multiple layers of components, which can lead to verbose code and decreased component encapsulation. In large and complex React applications, prop drilling can become a common issue, making the code harder to maintain and understand.


While prop drilling is a common and valid pattern in React, it can have drawbacks:

1. Complexity
2. Tight Coupling


Complexity:
As the component tree grows, prop drilling can make the code more complex and harder to maintain, especially when props need to be passed through many intermediary components.

Component Coupling:
It creates tight coupling between components in different parts of the hierarchy, making it difficult to refactor or reuse components without affecting their dependencies.

To mitigate the issues associated with prop drilling, you can consider alternative solutions such as:

-- Context API:
React's Context API allows you to share data and functions across components without explicitly passing props through each intermediate component. It can be a more efficient and cleaner way to handle shared state.

-- Redux or Mobx:
State management libraries like Redux or Mobx can centralize application state, making it accessible to any component in the tree without the need for prop drilling.

-- Custom Hooks:
Create custom hooks to encapsulate logic and state management, making it easier to share functionality across components.

-- Component Composition:
Practice component composition by breaking down large components into smaller, more focused ones. This can help reduce the need for prop drilling.

### 21. Explain Strict Mode in React.


"Strict Mode" is a development mode in React that is designed to help developers catch and diagnose potential problems and inconsistencies in their code during development. It is not intended for production use and has no impact on the behavior of the deployed application. Instead, it focuses on providing additional warnings and checks to improve code quality and find common mistakes.

```jsx
<React.StrictMode>
	<App />
</React.StrictMode>
```


Here are some of the key features and benefits of React's Strict Mode:

1. **Identifying Unsafe Practices:**
   - Strict Mode highlights common unsafe practices and potential problems in your code. For example, it can detect and warn about components with side effects in the `render` method, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

2. **Detecting Legacy Features:**
   - It warns about legacy features that are not recommended in modern React applications. For instance, using `componentWillMount`, `componentWillReceiveProps`, and other deprecated lifecycle methods will trigger warnings in Strict Mode.

3. **Checking for Unexpected Side Effects:**
   - Strict Mode checks for unexpected side effects during render. This includes detecting changes in state and props that result in re-renders of the component tree.

4. **Identifying Deprecated APIs:**
   - It helps you identify and migrate away from deprecated React APIs. This is useful for keeping your codebase up-to-date with the latest best practices.

5. **Highlighting Potential Problems:**
   - Strict Mode warns about potential problems, such as usage of non-standard string ref attributes, and helps you fix them early in the development process.

6. **Preventing "accidental" side effects:**
   - Strict Mode intentionally introduces certain checks that help prevent "accidental" side effects, such as reading and writing to global variables within a component.

7. **Identifying Unstable Functions:**
   - It warns about potentially unstable functions like `findDOMNode`, which can have unexpected behavior.

### 97. What is Redux?

Redux can help simplify the state management process, especially when dealing with complex and interconnected components. Here are some reasons why you might want to use Redux in your application.

Centralized state management:
With Redux, you can maintain the state of your entire application in a single store, making it easier to manage and access data across components.

Predictable state updates:
Redux has a clear flow of data, which means changes to the state can only happen when you create an action and send it through Redux. This makes it easy to understand how your 
application's data will change in response to user actions.

Easier debugging:
With Redux DevTools, you have a clear record of all the changes to your application's state. This makes locating and fixing issues in your code easier, saving you time and effort in the debugging process.

Better performance:
By minimizing the number of state updates and reducing the need for prop drilling, Redux helps improve your application's performance.

### useRef


- useRef is a React Hook that lets you reference a value that’s not needed for rendering.
- useRef returns a ref object with a single current property initially set to the initial value you provided.
- Call useRef at the top level of your component to declare a ref.
- You can mutate the ref.current property. Unlike state, it is mutable.
- When you change the ref.current property, React does not re-render your component.
- Changing a ref does not trigger a re-render.
- Changing a ref does not trigger a re-render, so refs are not appropriate for storing information you want to display on the screen.


### Single Source of Truth means

In the context of programming and data management, "Single Source of Truth" (SSOT) is a principle that refers to the practice of maintaining one definitive and authoritative source for a particular piece of information or data within a system. It means that a specific piece of data should have only one source, and all other references or representations of that data should derive from or synchronize with this single source.

Key aspects of the Single Source of Truth principle include:

1. **Consistency:** By ensuring that there is only one source for a given piece of data, you prevent inconsistencies or conflicts that could arise from having multiple sources that could potentially contain different or conflicting information.

2. **Reliability:** Having a single, central source of data enhances the reliability and accuracy of that data. It reduces the chances of data becoming outdated, stale, or incorrect due to discrepancies between multiple sources.

3. **Ease of Maintenance:** Maintaining and updating data is simpler when there is a single source to manage. It reduces the complexity of data synchronization and helps ensure that updates are consistently applied.

4. **Predictability:** Developers and users can more easily predict the behavior of the system because there is a clear, authoritative source of truth for the data.

5. **Efficiency:** Data synchronization and data retrieval are typically more efficient when there's a single source. Systems can avoid unnecessary duplication and processing of data.

In software development, the Single Source of Truth principle is commonly applied to various scenarios, including:

- **State Management:** In frameworks like React and Redux, maintaining a single source of truth for the application's state simplifies data management and ensures that UI components always display the correct information.

- **Database Management:** In databases, having a single source of truth ensures that data remains consistent and eliminates the risk of data anomalies.

- **Configuration Management:** Storing configuration settings in one central location ensures that all parts of an application or system use the same configuration values.

- **Version Control:** In version control systems like Git, the repository is considered the single source of truth for the project's source code, allowing multiple developers to collaborate on a single codebase.

Overall, adhering to the Single Source of Truth principle helps maintain data integrity, reduces complexity, and enhances the reliability and maintainability of software systems.
