If your frightening to put yourself in unconfortable zone, think about it, a man left all his family memeber by faith in God,  one boy stand against the ghait with just swing and stones, and a person step into the water. God wants you to step out from your confort zone to the uncofortable zone where the maricles happen.

A man once left behind all his family members in faith, a boy faced a giant armed with only a sling and stones, and a person stepped into the water. These examples show that God often calls us to step out of our comfort zones and into uncomfortable territory where miracles can happen. If you are hesitant to do so, remember that taking risks can lead to great rewards.
