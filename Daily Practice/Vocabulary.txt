In summary, the line "Gotta watch 'em bleed too" is a metaphorical way of conveying the speaker's determination to prove their critics wrong and ensure that those who doubted them also face the consequences or difficulties in some way, perhaps as a form of poetic justice or retribution. It's a common theme in music lyrics to use metaphorical language to express emotions and intentions.

Obstacles: Adversity: Life-threatening circumstance
metaphorically 

Don't put worth inside: In this context, "putting worth inside" someone means investing your time, energy, or emotions into a person. It's about placing value or trust in someone.

cautioning: 
So, the line is essentially advising against investing your time, emotions, or trust in someone who is not making an effort or isn't worthy of that investment. It suggests that it's important to be discerning and not waste your resources on individuals who don't appreciate or reciprocate your efforts. This advice is common in various life situations, where people are warned to be selective in their relationships and associations to avoid being taken advantage of or disappointed.

The term "discarded" generally means to get rid of or throw away something. It implies a deliberate decision to eliminate or reject something. For example:
"The old furniture was discarded when we moved to a new house."
In a different context, the term can be used metaphorically to indicate the rejection or abandonment of an idea, plan, or concept:
"After careful consideration, they discarded the original proposal and opted for a new approach."
So, "discarded" essentially means to cast aside, reject, or dispose of something.
