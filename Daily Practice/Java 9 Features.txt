Java 9 Features


- Interface Private Methods: We can create private method inside an interface. Those private method can be used to called by default methods.

- Try-With Resources: we don't need to close resources (file, connection, network etc) explicitly.


- Anonymous Classes Improvement

- Java @SafeVarargs Annotation


- Java Collection Factory Methods:



- Java New Version-String Scheme
- JShell
- Java 9 Stream API Improvement

- Try-With-Resources: Resource declared outside the try block will not work prior to java 9. Only if a resource declared inside the try block will work.

- Diamond Operator Extension: Java 9 introduced a new feature that allows us to use diamond operator with anonymous classes. Using the diamond with anonymous classes was not allowed in Java 7.s

In Java 9, as long as the inferred type is denotable, we can use the diamond operator when we create an anonymous inner class.
