Sealed classes offer benefits such as improved encapsulation, enhanced readability, and better maintainability of code.

Imagine you're building a game where you have different types of characters: knights, wizards, and archers. Each character type has its own special abilities and behaviors.

Now, let's relate this to programming:

In programming, these character types can be represented as classes. So, you'd have a Knight class, a Wizard class, and an Archer class.

Now, let's say you want to make sure that only these three types of characters can be created in your game. You don't want someone creating a new type of character that doesn't fit into these categories.

This is where sealed classes come in. You can declare your Character class as sealed, which means only certain classes (like Knight, Wizard, and Archer) are allowed to extend it.

So, in simple terms, sealed classes help you control who can create new types of objects based on a certain class. They make sure your class hierarchy stays organized and predictable, just like making sure your game only has knights, wizards, and archers and not some random new type of character.

Sealed classes involve two new keywords â€” sealed and permits:

```java
sealed class A permits B, C, D {
}

final class B extends A {
}

non-sealed class C extends A {
}

sealed class D extends A permits E {
}

final class E extends D {
}

class F extends C {
}

final class G {
}
```

sealed class A { } // Error
---
sealed class A  permits B, C {
}

class B extends A {
	// Error : The class B with a sealed direct superclass or a sealed direct superinterface A should be declared either final, sealed, or non-sealed.
}
---

The term "compilation unit" refers to a source file that is compiled together, along with all the classes and interfaces it contains.

- direct superclass
- sealed direct superclass



- The class with a sealed direct superclass or a sealed direct superinterface A should be declared either final, sealed, or non-sealed.
- A type declaration on class that has a permits clause should have a sealed modifier.
- A class declared as non-sealed should have either a sealed direct superclass or a sealed direct superinterface.
- This finite and exhaustive hierarchy is one of the great benefits of using sealed classes.

Hidden classes

Certainly! Let's simplify it:

1. **What are Hidden Classes?**
   - Hidden classes are like secret helpers that Java's behind-the-scenes system uses to do certain tasks without bothering the main code.
   - They're created on-the-fly by the Java system and are hidden from regular code, meaning you can't directly use or see them in your Java programs.

2. **Why Do We Need Hidden Classes?**
   - Imagine you're playing a video game. The game's engine needs to create lots of characters, monsters, and objects on the fly, without cluttering up the main game code. Hidden classes act like these background characters, helping the game run smoothly without you even knowing they're there.
   - Similarly, in Java, when you use features like reflection or dynamic code generation, the system might need to create classes while your program is running. These classes aren't part of your main codebase but help the Java system do its job efficiently.

3. **How Do They Work?**
   - When Java needs to create a hidden class, it does so quietly, without bothering your main code.
   - These classes are managed by Java's internal system and are optimized for specific tasks, like handling reflection or dynamic code generation.
   - They're kept hidden to keep your main code clean and secure, and they're managed efficiently to ensure your Java programs run smoothly.


In Java, you cannot directly create hidden classes in your code like you would with regular classes. Hidden classes are generated by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) at runtime for specific tasks, such as dynamic code generation, reflection, or other internal optimizations.

In simple terms, hidden classes are like behind-the-scenes helpers in a play or a video game. They quietly do their job to help the main program run smoothly without causing any fuss or getting in the way.
