you are given an undirected graph consisting of N vertices, numberd from 1 to N, and M edges, the graph is discribed by two arrays, A and B both of length M.A pair(A[k],B[K]), for K 0 to M-1, describes an edge between vertex A[K] and vertex B[K]
 
your task is to assign all values from the range [1...N] to the vertices of the graph, giving one number to each of the verices, Do it in such away that the sum overall edges of the values at the edges` end points is maximul.
 
for example given N = 5, A=[2,2,1,2], B=[1,3,4,4], that graph has 4 edges: (2,1),(2,3),(1,4),(2,4). in order to obtain the maximum sum of weights, you can assign the following values to the vertices: 3,5,2,4,1 (to vertices 1,2,3,4,5 respectively)
 
this way we obtain the sum of values at all edge` endpoints = 7+8+7+9 = 31:
 
edge(2,3): 7 = 5(vertex2)+2(vertex3)  
edge(2,1): 8 = 5(vertex2)+3(vertex1) 
edge(1,4): 7 = 3(vertex1)+4(vertex4) 
edge(2,4): 9 = 5(vertex2)+4(vertex4)
 
notice that the value assigned to vertex 5 did not have any effect on the final result as it is not an end point of any edge.
that, given a positive integer N and two arrays A,B of M positive Integers, returns the maximum possible sum of values of the edges` endpoints.
 
example: given N = 5, A=[2,2,1,2], B=[1,3,4,4], the function should return 31 as explianed above

You are writing an endpoint that returns the total number of items bought in your online store by a given user. Orders in your system are stored in an external service called OrdersService. Your task is to:
 
• write an endpoint in the given UsersController class;
 
• write a method in the given UsersService class that counts the number of items bought by the given user;
 
• configure the UsersController and UsersService classes.
 
Solving this task requires from you editing the following three files. Please make sure they are all present in your final solution.
 
com.codility.app. AppConfiguration
 
com.codility.app.UsersController
 
⚫com.codility.app. UsersService
 
Interfaces
 
The UsersService class declares:
 
⚫ a field ordersService: private OrdersService ordersService
 
⚫ a method getNumberOfItems Bought: public int getNumberOfItemsBought(String username)
 
The UsersController class declares:
 
1.a field usersService: private UsersService usersService
 
2 .  A method totalItemsBought: public Map<String, Integer> totalItemsBought()
 
they are all present in your initial solution
 
 
Environment
 
Your application is written with the Spring Framework.
 
Your Spring context is already populated with the OrdersService bean that implements the following interface:
 
package com.codility.external;
 
import java.util.List;
 
public interface OrdersService {
 
List<Item> itemsBought(String username);
 
}
 
Note that OrdersService is located in the com.codility.external package, whereas your application uses the com.codility.app package.
 
requirements
 
1. Make sure that the AppConfiguration class is treated as a Spring configuration bean.
 
2. Configure Spring to scan for beans in the com.codility.external package.
 
3. Prepare the OrdersService bean (please refer to the signatures described above):
 
• Inject the OrdersService bean into the ordersService field.
 
• Use it in the getNumberOfItemsBought method to count the number of items bought by the given user.
 
4. Inject UsersService into UsersController.
 
5. Use it in the totalItems Bought method to fetch the number of items bought by the given user.
 
6. The totalItems Bought method should implement the following contract:
 
⚫ endpoint URL: /users/(username}/items/total, where username is a path variable;
 
• response JSON format: ("totalItemsBought": number), where number is the number of items bought by the given user;
 
⚫ status code 200 in case of a successful response.
 
7. Make sure you pass the username variable to the totalItemsBought call.
 
8. For simplicity, you don't have to write any input validation or error handling.
 
9. You are working with the Spring Framework version 5.1.7 and Java 8.

Let the number of ones in the ith row be onesRowi.
Let the number of ones in the jth column be onesColj.
Let the number of zeros in the ith row be zerosRowi.
Let the number of zeros in the jth column be zerosColj.
diff[i][j] = onesRowi + onesColj - zerosRowi - zerosColj
Return the difference matrix diff.
Input: grid = [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[0,0,1]]
Output: [[0,0,4],[0,0,4],[-2,-2,2]]

Microservice Design Problem Statement 
Use SpringBoot version 2+, Host below microservices in a aws free tier account.
 
TASK 1  
 
Goal: Create a three service microservice project to demonstrate orchestration, rest api invocation, error handling, tracing of logs in javaEE or Node.js Services should communicate with aws hosted URLs
 
 
1st Service) Expose two http methods, one get and one post (add swaggerUI).
From the get method return “Up” if service is up. The post method should return the concatenated responses of the Get call of Service 2 and the Post call of Service 3 using the same payload({The json})
 
2nd Service) It contains one get method which is called by the first service to fetch a string”Hello” wrapped with a spring response entity.
 
3rd Service) This exposes one post method which is called by first service to print/log the passed json and return the concatenated name elements as a string (example - “John Doe”) 
 
Print logs before each method call with a traceID to trace the call flow. 
 
The json.
{
“Name”: “John”,
“Surname”:”Doe”
} 
 
Concatenated Response :-
{
“Hello John Doe”
}
 
Extra: Handle exception when passed Json in post calls is not valid


Create 
Db Connection: 
Host a database in local or aws (postgres or mysql or in memory db(H2)).
Configure your microservice to connect to db.
Create Hibernate Entity Class  based on the below table requirement to auto create tables in hosted db.
Populate the db from a post request with the below data or directly insert into db.
 
Expose endpoints to fetch requests based on Id and complete list of objects.
While getting the complete table, Modify the result set(arrays or list) to form nested object structure.
Below is the nested output in json.Associate color to each object according to table.
 
Create a table with fields ID, Name, Color, ParentId and populate with below data.
Don't use ORM to map or form parent child relationships. Write an algorithm to form the relationship after fetching the list from db, in an efficient way.

SELECT employees.name AS employee_name, departments.name AS department_name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;

The INNER JOIN ensures that only rows with matching department IDs in both tables are returned.


2.LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN):

SELECT students.name AS student_name, grades.grade_letter
FROM students
LEFT JOIN grades ON students.grade_id = grades.id;

 The LEFT JOIN ensures that all rows from the students table are returned, along with matching rows from the grades table. 
 If there is no matching row in the grades table, NULL values are returned for the columns from the grades table.

3.RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN):

SELECT orders.order_id, orders.order_date, customers.customer_name
FROM orders
RIGHT JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;

 The RIGHT JOIN ensures that all rows from the customers table are returned, along with matching rows from the orders table. 
 If there is no matching row in the orders table, NULL values are returned for the columns from the orders table.

4. FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN):

SELECT employees.employee_id, employees.employee_name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
FULL JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;


The FULL JOIN ensures that all rows from both the employees and departments tables are returned.

5.CROSS JOIN:

SELECT students.student_id, students.student_name, subjects.subject_id, subjects.subject_name
FROM students
CROSS JOIN subjects;

The CROSS JOIN combines every row from the students table with every row from the subjects table, 
resulting in a list of all possible combinations of students and subjects.

6.SELF JOIN:

SELECT e.employee_id, e.employee_name, m.employee_name AS manager_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id;
