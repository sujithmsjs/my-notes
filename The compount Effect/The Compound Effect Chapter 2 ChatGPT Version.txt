The second chapter of "The Compound Effect" explains that our lives are the result of our moment-to-moment choices. Even the smallest decision we make can change the course of our life. All the things that exist in our lives are there because we made choices about them. Choices are the root of every result we experience, and each decision begins a behavior that can become a habit over time. However, 99 percent of our choices are unconscious, so we need to make an effort to be aware of them and choose wisely.

The author points out that our biggest challenge is not intentionally making bad choices, but rather sleepwalking through them. We make choices without thinking, which prevents us from consciously changing ineffective behaviors and turning them into productive habits. To make empowering choices, we must wake up and be aware of our decisions.

The author stresses that taking responsibility for our lives is crucial, but many people blame others for their problems instead of taking full responsibility. To achieve success, we must take complete responsibility for everything that happens to us, good or bad, and become aware of the choices that lead us away from our desired destination.

The chapter also introduces the formula for getting lucky, which is preparation (personal growth), attitude (belief/mindset), opportunity (a good thing coming our way), and action (doing something about it). We need to consistently improve and prepare ourselves, see situations as fortuitous, be ready to take action when an opportunity arises, and have a positive mindset.

The author explains that small choices can make a significant impact on our lives. Tracking every action that relates to the area of our lives we want to improve can increase our awareness of how we choose between good and bad options. Tracking is a simple exercise that works because it brings awareness to the actions we take, and we cannot improve something until we measure it.

Finally, the chapter highlights the power of little things adding up over time. Success belongs to those who take small, seemingly insignificant steps consistently over time. The author uses the example of a horse winning by a nose but getting ten times the prize money, not because it is ten times faster, but because of the countless little things that make it better. The same applies to our lives; it's the little things that add up to separate the ordinary from the extraordinary.
