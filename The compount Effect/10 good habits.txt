The phrase "what if you had woken when you were supposed to?" is a hypothetical statement that implies a different outcome if a particular event had occurred as expected. In this case, it suggests that if you had woken up at the intended time, something different or better could have happened.

For example, let's say you were supposed to wake up early to study for an exam, but you overslept and missed your study time. If someone were to say "what if you had woken when you were supposed to?" it would imply that you could have done better on the exam if you had studied as planned.

This phrase can also be used in a more general sense to reflect on missed opportunities or regrets. For instance, if someone says, "What if you had woken when you were supposed to and gone on that trip?" it would imply that you missed out on an experience that could have been enjoyable if you had followed through with your original plan.

Overall, the phrase "what if you had woken when you were supposed to?" is a way of imagining an alternate reality where things happened differently because a particular event went as planned.
