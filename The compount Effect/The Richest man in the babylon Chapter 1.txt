Bansir, a chariot builder from Babylon, was feeling discouraged. He was sitting on a wall outside his home, looking at his partially built chariot and feeling upset. His wife kept coming to the door, reminding him that they were almost out of food and he needed to finish the chariot to collect payment from their wealthy customer.

Despite this, Bansir sat on the wall, trying to solve a problem that he couldn't figure out. The hot sun was beating down on him, and he was sweating. Beyond his home, he could see the grand walls of the king's palace and the painted tower of the Temple of Bel. Babylon was a mix of grandeur and squalor, with both wealth and poverty crowded together.

Behind him, he could hear the noise of rich people's chariots pushing past tradesmen and beggars. Even the rich had to move aside for the slave water carriers who were delivering water to the hanging gardens on the "king's business."

Bansir was so focused on his problem that he didn't notice his friend, Kobbi, playing his lyre nearby. Kobbi greeted him and asked for two shekels, but Bansir sadly replied that he didn't have any to spare. Kobbi was surprised and asked why Bansir wasn't working on his chariot, as he needed to earn money to feed himself and his wife. Bansir explained that he was upset because he had dreamed he was wealthy, with a purse full of coins that he spent freely. But when he woke up, he realized it was just a dream, and he had no money at all.

Bansir and Kobbi had been friends since childhood and had always been content to work hard and spend their earnings freely. But now, after a lifetime of labor, they were both feeling discontented. They lived in the wealthiest city in the world, surrounded by displays of wealth, but they had nothing. They had earned a lot of money over the years, but they had never known the joys that came with wealth. They felt like dumb sheep, working hard but never achieving anything.

but even a great deal of wealth cannot buy happiness or contentment. It is true that we live in a wealthy city, but we must not compare ourselves to those who have more than us. We must be grateful for what we have and strive to make the best of it. We must find joy in the simple things of life, like spending time with our loved ones and doing work that we enjoy."

Kobbi nodded in agreement. "You speak wisely, my friend. We must not let our desires for material wealth cloud our judgment and make us forget the things that truly matter in life."

Bansir smiled, feeling better after having shared his troubles with his friend. "Thank you for listening, Kobbi. Your words have brought me comfort."

The two friends sat in silence for a while, enjoying the warmth of the sun and the gentle breeze that blew through the streets of Babylon. Bansir felt a renewed sense of purpose, and he knew that he would go back to his workshop and work on the chariot with renewed energy and enthusiasm.

As he stood up to leave, Kobbi gave him a hearty clap on the back. "Go now, my friend, and let the work of your hands bring you joy and contentment. And remember, true wealth is not measured by the amount of gold in our purses, but by the richness of our hearts and the love that we share with others."

Bansir nodded, feeling grateful for the wise words of his friend. As he walked back to his workshop, he knew that he would always treasure their friendship and the simple joys of life that they shared together.

Another potential strategy is to try to shift your focus to more positive thoughts and activities. When you find yourself dwelling on negative thoughts, try to redirect your attention to something that brings you joy or peace. This could be anything from listening to your favorite music to going for a walk in nature.

Additionally, practicing mindfulness can be helpful for managing negative thoughts and emotions. Mindfulness involves paying attention to the present moment in a non-judgmental way. When you notice a negative thought or feeling arise, try to observe it without getting caught up in it or judging yourself for having it. Instead, simply acknowledge the thought or feeling and allow it to pass.

Finally, seeking support from a therapist or counselor can be very helpful for managing negative thoughts and emotions. A mental health professional can help you identify negative thought patterns and develop strategies for coping with them. They can also provide a safe and supportive space for you to process your emotions and work through any underlying issues that may be contributing to your negativity.
