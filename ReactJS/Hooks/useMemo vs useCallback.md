In this example, `handleClick` is memoized using `useCallback`, ensuring that the same function reference is used across renders of `ParentComponent`. This can be important when passing the function as a prop to child components to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

### Key Differences:

1. **Use Case:**
   - Use `useMemo` when you want to memoize a value (e.g., the result of a computation).
   - Use `useCallback` when you want to memoize a function.

2. **Arguments:**
   - `useMemo` takes a function and an array of dependencies. It memoizes the result of the function based on changes in dependencies.
   - `useCallback` takes a function and an array of dependencies. It memoizes the function itself based on changes in dependencies.

3. **Return Value:**
   - `useMemo` returns the memoized value.
   - `useCallback` returns the memoized function.

- While `useMemo` and `useCallback` share similarities, choosing between them depends on whether you are memoizing a value or a function.
- Use them judiciously to optimize your components when needed.
