I have always found it interesting that the most successful people,
the truly top performers, are the ones willing to hire and pay for
the best coaches and trainers there are.

The psychic clutter:
Creating a positive environment to support your success means clearing out
all the clutter in your life.

Each and every incomplete thing in your life exerts a draining force
on you, sucking the energy of accomplishment and success out of
you as surely as a vampire stealing your blood.

Every incomplete
promise, commitment, and agreement saps your strength because it
blocks your momentum and inhibits your ability to move forward.

you will get in life what you accept and expect you are worthy of.

It’s amazing how life will organize around the standards you
set for yourself. Some people think they’re the victims of other
people’s behavior, but in actuality, we have control over how
people treat us. Protect your emotional, mental, and physical
space so you can live with peace, rather than in the chaos and
stress the world will hurl upon you.
