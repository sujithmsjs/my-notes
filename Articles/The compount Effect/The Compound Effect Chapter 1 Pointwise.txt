THE COMPOUND EFFECT IN ACTION

Introduction:
The Compound Effect is the principle of reaping huge rewards from a series of small, smart choices. Here are some examples of how it works in action:

I. Small, Smart Choices + Consistency + Time = RADICAL DIFFERENCE

Smart or the fastest may not always win. However, those who develop positive habits along with consistency do.
Even though the results are massive, the steps, in the moment, don’t feel significant.
Small, seemingly insignificant steps completed consistently over time create a radical difference.
II. The Ripple Effect

Even one small change can have a significant impact that causes an unexpected and unintended ripple effect.
Believing that the other person is wrong rather than looking inside and doing the work necessary to clean up your mess is basic Psychology 101 stuff.
III. The Most Challenging Aspect of the Compound Effect

We have to keep working away for a while, consistently and efficiently, before we can begin to see the payoff.
The secret to success is hard work, discipline, and good habits.
IV. Success as Granted

Nothing fails like success. People get to a certain level of success and get too comfortable.
Real and lasting success requires work—and lots of it!
By putting the Compound Effect to work for you, the results, the life, and the lifestyle of your dreams can be yours.
