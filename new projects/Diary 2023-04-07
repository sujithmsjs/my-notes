I had a nightmare where I was unfairly terminated from my job today.

In my dream, I was unjustly fired from my job and felt deeply unsettled, resulting in my departure from the workplace. The experience served as a clear reminder for me to be grateful for what I have and avoid complaining.

As I have always maintained, it's important to appreciate what you have and strive to achieve a little more.

I attended the Good Friday service along with Pranihsa. I was really happy about it. Everything I want I had now. A sense of satisfaction is my victory.

I am compelled to give you an instance of being satisfied.

Your Girl is pure Gold except all girls are sparkling colored stones. You don't have to go after the attritive colored stone when you have pure Gold in hand. Never ever let just sparkling stones steal your attention.

Your significant other is truly exceptional. Don't be tempted by the allure of a colorful stone when you already possess a precious, pure Gold. Always remain focused on what truly matters and don't let yourself be distracted by superficial attractions.
